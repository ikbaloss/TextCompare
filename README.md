TextCompare is an HTML5/JavaScript application designed to compare two text files by plotting the top n most frequent words from each file. Users can explore individual words in the graph by double-clicking them, which reveals a table below the graph showing sentences from both files that contain the selected word.

You can use the app directly—no download required—at:
